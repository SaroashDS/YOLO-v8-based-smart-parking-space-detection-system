## Overview
Welcome to our advanced Parking Management System, an innovative solution leveraging state-of-the-art technologies for efficient and intelligent parking space utilization. This project combines computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data processing to optimize parking space management in urban environments.

## Problem Statement
In urban planning and remote sensing, accurately estimating building heights is crucial for various applications. This project aims to provide a solution to this challenge by leveraging deep learning techniques to estimate building heights from monocular remote sensing imagery.

## Solution

The YOLO-v8-based Smart Parking Space Detection System introduces a cutting-edge solution to revolutionize parking space management. By leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8 architecture, the system can detect and monitor parking spaces in real-time. The solution offers the following key features:

- Real-time parking space detection using YOLO-v8
- User-friendly interface for visualizing parking availability
- Notifications for parking space status changes (In-progress)
- Historical data analysis for parking space utilization (In-progress)
